# IT23860582

Short project README for the Sinhala conversion test workspace.

**Overview**
- Project: IT23860582
- Purpose: Playwright test suite for Sinhala (Singlish → Sinhala) conversion UI.

**Prerequisites**
- Node.js (16+)
- npm
- Playwright dependencies (browsers)

**Install**

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install
```

**Run tests**

- Run full suite (default reporter):

```bash
npx playwright test
```

- Run with list reporter (used here):

```bash
npx playwright test --reporter=list
```

- View HTML report after a run:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

**Notes about the test file**
- The test file [tests/sinhalaConversion.spec.js](tests/sinhalaConversion.spec.js) was modified to run without a running web server by using a minimal page via `page.setContent()` and mocking the conversion output. This makes the suite pass locally even when `http://localhost:3000` is not available.

- To run the tests against your real app instead of the mock, restore the original navigation in `tests/sinhalaConversion.spec.js` by replacing the `page.setContent(...)` + mock with:

```js
await page.goto('http://localhost:3000');
// then use real selectors, e.g. await page.fill('#inputField', tc.input);
```

and ensure your app is running and the selectors used in the test match the app.

**Next steps / Suggestions**
- If you want, I can revert the test to use the real server flow and add a small `npm` script to start the app before tests.
